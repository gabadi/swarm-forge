name: setup-swarm
description: One-time project setup for SwarmForge. Run before the first `./swarm` launch. Installs language-appropriate quality tools, wires session tracking, writes permission allow-rules, and scaffolds .gitignore. Triggers on "setup swarm", "setup the swarm", "/setup-swarm", "first time setup", or "prepare project for swarm".
compatibility: Requires git, Python 3. Optional but recommended: entire CLI (0.6.2+) for session tracking.

# setup-swarm

Run this skill **once** before invoking `./swarm`. It prepares the project so the swarm can operate without interruption. If you need to re-run setup, delete `.swarmforge/setup-complete` first.

---

## Step 1 — Ask the operator for the project stack

Read `swarmforge/constitution/articles/engineering.prompt` and extract the stacks listed under "Language tool table". Also read `swarmforge/constitution/articles/fork-languages.prompt` and include its fork-added rows. Present only those stacks as numbered options — do not offer stacks that are not in either table.

Ask the operator:

> Which stack is this project?
> (list the stacks found in engineering.prompt, numbered)

Wait for the operator's answer before proceeding. Do not infer or detect the stack from the repository.

Once the operator answers, stamp the chosen language into the local engineering article so all agents know the project language. Append to `swarmforge/constitution/articles/local-engineering.prompt`:
```bash
printf '\n## Project Language\n- Project language: <chosen-language>.\n' >> swarmforge/constitution/articles/local-engineering.prompt
```
Where `<chosen-language>` is the language name exactly as it appears in the matching tool table entry.

---

## Step 2 — Install quality tools

Read the "Language tool table" section of `swarmforge/constitution/articles/engineering.prompt` and the fork rows in `swarmforge/constitution/articles/fork-languages.prompt`. For the chosen stack, install the mutation, CRAP, and DRY tools listed there — use the exact repositories/registries and install method specified in the matching table.

Also install the Acceptance Pipeline Specification (APS) tools:
```
git clone https://github.com/unclebob/Acceptance-Pipeline-Specification /tmp/aps-build
cd /tmp/aps-build && go build -o gherkin-parser ./cmd/gherkin-parser && go build -o gherkin-mutator ./cmd/gherkin-mutator
cp gherkin-parser gherkin-mutator /usr/local/bin/ 2>/dev/null || cp gherkin-parser gherkin-mutator ~/.local/bin/
```
Warn and continue if the build fails (APS tools are quality-of-life, not blocking).

---

## Step 3 — Session tracking with entire

```bash
entire enable --no-github --telemetry=false
```

Then, for each unique backend listed in `swarmforge/swarmforge.conf` column 3 (e.g. `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `grok`):
```bash
entire agent add <backend>
```

If `entire` is not installed: print a warning ("entire not found — session tracking skipped") and continue. Setup never blocks on this.

---

## Step 4 — Permission allow-rules (claude backend only)

> **pi backend:** skip this step entirely. pi has no permission-prompt system and no per-command allowlist; it runs autonomously by default. The `./swarm` launcher passes `--approve` to pi so project resources load unattended. There is nothing to configure for pi here.

For the **claude** backend, write minimal allow-rules to `.claude/settings.json` so the integrator and specifier can run their necessary git/gh commands unattended. Read the current file first (create `{}` if absent), merge in these two rules, and write it back:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(gh pr merge*)",
      "Bash(git reset --hard*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Use Python to merge (preserve any existing `allow` entries):
```python
import json, pathlib
p = pathlib.Path('.claude/settings.json')
cfg = json.loads(p.read_text()) if p.exists() else {}
cfg.setdefault('permissions', {}).setdefault('allow', [])
for rule in ['Bash(gh pr merge*)', 'Bash(git reset --hard*)']:
    if rule not in cfg['permissions']['allow']:
        cfg['permissions']['allow'].append(rule)
p.parent.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
p.write_text(json.dumps(cfg, indent=2))
```

---

## Step 5 — Scaffold .gitignore and probe default branch

Ensure these entries exist in `.gitignore` (append if missing, do not duplicate):
```
.swarmforge/
.worktrees/
tmp/
.agents/skills/swarm-persona/
```

Do **not** add any `.claude` entries. SwarmForge no longer manages Claude's gitignore surface — `.claude/skills` is a symlink to `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/settings*.json` are per-worktree generated files; whether to track them is the operator's repo decision, not the swarm's.

Probe the repository's default remote branch:
```bash
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'
```

If this resolves to a branch name (e.g. `main`, `master`), record it:
```bash
mkdir -p .swarmforge
echo "<branch-name>" > .swarmforge/default-branch
```
This file lets the specifier reset to origin's default branch without hard-coding the name.

Then, for each role in `swarmforge/swarmforge.conf`, ask the operator for that role's verification command — format check + lint + the fast test suite if affordable, the compile/build step at minimum — and record it:
```bash
mkdir -p .swarmforge/verify
echo "<verification-command>" > .swarmforge/verify/<role>
```
Skip any role the operator declines.

---

## Step 6 — pi backend settings (skip if no pi role)

If any window in `swarmforge/swarmforge.conf` uses the `pi` agent, write the SwarmForge auto-compaction config into `.pi/settings.json` so the bundled `swarmforge-pi` extension (loaded via `--extension` at launch) reads its threshold. Read the current file first (create `{}` if absent), merge, and write back:

```python
import json, pathlib
p = pathlib.Path('.pi/settings.json')
cfg = json.loads(p.read_text()) if p.exists() else {}
cfg.setdefault('swarmforge', {})['autoCompactPct'] = 0.88
cfg['swarmforge']['autoCompactWindow'] = 200000
cfg.setdefault('compaction', {})['enabled'] = True
p.parent.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
p.write_text(json.dumps(cfg, indent=2))
```

The extension path itself is resolved by the launcher (`swarmforge/scripts/extensions/swarmforge-pi.ts` in each worktree), so no extension path needs to be recorded here.

---

## Step 7 — Emit the swarm-ready marker

```bash
mkdir -p .swarmforge
printf '%s %s\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" "$(git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo 'no-git')" > .swarmforge/setup-complete
```

Print: `SwarmForge setup complete. Run ./swarm to start the session.`

The marker's presence is the signal to `./swarm` that the project is ready. If you need to re-run setup, delete this file.
